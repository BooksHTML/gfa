        <title>The Eight-Step: Adding Commits to the Definitive Repository</title>

        <introduction>
            <p>We will describe the process of moving commits on a <q>topic</q> branch in a local repository to the master branch of a definitive repository where you have permission to push, and the repository is configured as a remote in your local repository.  Eventually, the logic of this procedure will become second nature.</p>
        </introduction>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><c>git checkout master</c></p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><c>git pull upstream master</c></p>
                <p>Now you are on your master branch and have the latest version of the project.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><c>git branch &lt;branchname&gt;</c></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><c>git checkout &lt;branchname&gt;</c></p>
                <p>Now you are on a new branch called &lt;branchname&gt;</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Make the changes you planned. When appropriate do</p>
                <p><c>git add &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt; &dots;</c></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><c>git rebase master</c></p>
                <p>Move the branch point of the topic branch to the tip of updated master.  Resolve any conflicts which occur during the replay phase of the rebase.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><c>git checkout master</c></p>
                <p>Move back to the local master branch in preparation for modifying it.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><c>git branch -d topic</c></p>
                <p>The topic branch pointer is obsolete as it duplicates the master branch pointer.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><c>git merge topic</c></p>
                <p>Use a fast-forward merge to bring the topic branch into the master branch.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><c>git push</c></p>
                <p>Move new commits on the local master branch to the master branch of the definitive repository.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
