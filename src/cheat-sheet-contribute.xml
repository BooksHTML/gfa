    <p>You have forked a repository and cloned your fork to your laptop.
You have <c>origin</c> as a remote to your fork, and <c>upstream</c>
as a remote to the official repository for the project.
Below are all the steps you typically need for contributing to the project.</p>

            <p>Below is a quick guide for those who already understand the basics of git.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><c>git checkout master</c></p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><c>git pull upstream master</c></p>
                <p>Now you are on your master branch and have the latest version of the project.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><c>git branch &lt;branchname&gt;</c></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><c>git checkout &lt;branchname&gt;</c></p>
                <p>Now you are on a new branch called &lt;branchname&gt;.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Make the changes you planned. When appropriate do</p>
                <p><c>git add &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt; ...</c></p>
                <p><c>git commit -m "useful commit message"</c></p>
            </li>
            <li xml:id="check-before-submitting">
                <p>Check your work: run <c>latex</c>, or compile the code,
or whatever is appropriate for the project.
Save yourself the embarrasment of having a pull request rejected because
you submitted something broken!</p>
           </li>

            <li>
                <p><c>git pull upstream master</c></p>
                <p>Do that in case new material has been added since the
last time you pulled.
It can't hurt to repeat step<nbsp /><xref ref="check-before-submitting" />.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><c>git push origin &lt;branchname&gt;</c></p>
                <p>And then go to your fork on GitHub and make a pull request..</p>
                <p>Be sure to describe how to see your changes in the final product.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p> When in doubt, do <c>git status</c> to find out what branch you
are on, and to see if there are uncommitted changes.</p>
