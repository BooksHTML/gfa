    <title>Git Miscellany</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>This final chapter is a loose collection of tidbits that you may find useful, without getting too technical or arcane.  We have not tried to cover everything, and we may have told you a few white lies along the way.  When you exhaust what we have here, re-read <xref ref="parting-shot" />, and send us a pull request if you have something useful (and not too arcane) for this chapter.</p>
